I currently live in Santa Cruz, CA. I've been a professional web developer since 2011 and since 2017, I have been the [Senior Web Developer](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=jchafin) on the [Communications & Marketing](https://communications.ucsc.edu) team at UC Santa Cruz.

Prior to entering the web development field, I was in the urban planning field. I spent over a decade as a planning consultant, working throughout the Monterey and San Francisco Bay Areas, primarily for public agencies (cities, counties, coastal commissions, port authorities).

I began my web development career as a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) developer and WordPress is still my "first love" when it comes to web technology.

As a Senior Web Developer, I manage a portfolio of UC Santa Cruz web properties and contribute to the design, development and maintenance of the UC Santa Cruz brand.

The portfolio of sites that I have built and currently maintain include:
