I currently live in Santa Cruz, CA. I became a professional web developer in 2011. In 2017, became the [Senior Web Developer](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=jchafin) on the [Communications & Marketing](https://communications.ucsc.edu) team at UC Santa Cruz.

Prior to entering the web development field, I was in the urban planning field. I spent over a decade as a planning consultant, working throughout the Monterey and San Francisco Bay Areas, primarily for public agencies (cities, counties, coastal commissions, port authorities).

I began my web development career as a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) developer and WordPress is still my "first love" when it comes to web technology. Since then, however, I have created sites using a variety of web technologies, including Drupal, React, Vue and Jekyll.

As a Senior Web Developer for UC Santa Cruz, I manage a portfolio of campus web properties and contribute to the design, development and maintenance of the UC Santa Cruz brand.

Portfolio examples include:

- [Communications & Marketing](https://communications.ucsc.edu)
- [Events Calendar](https://events.ucsc.edu/) ([Localist](https://www.localist.com/))
- [Giving to UC Santa Cruz](https://giving.ucsc.edu/)
- [UC Santa Cruz Ethics Bowl](https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/ethics-bowl/)

I am currently working on UC Santa Cruz's rebranding and re-platforming project. The bulk of my work on this project is assisting in the development of a [custom WordPress block theme](https://github.com/ucsc/ucsc-2022).
